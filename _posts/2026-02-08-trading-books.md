Most trading mistakes are not strategy problems — they’re **thinking problems**.

These are books that changed how I think about markets, risk, cycles, and decision-making.  
Many are also excellent as **audiobooks** if you prefer learning while walking, commuting, or staring at charts.

## Why these books?

Because markets change, but **human behavior doesn’t**.

Most of these were written decades apart, yet they describe the **same mistakes**, the **same emotions**, and the **same cycles** repeating again and again.

That’s the real edge.
