# Sure thing

In **1875**, an Ohio farmer Samuel Benner published this diagram in his book 'Benners Prophecies
future ups and downs in prices'.

The diagram marks extreme years in 3 categories from top to bottom.

* Panics
* Good times high prices
* Hard times low prices

## The stock market: 150 years later

As successful farmer, having suffered severe losses in the market panic of 1873, he set out to study market cycles to find a way to prepare for future panics.
Although concerned with different markets in 1875 than today it is interesting that some predicted future cycles appear relevant.

Significant years that stand out in this diagram:

### Panics

## Digging deeper

Let's look closed into the high prices cycle as 2026 is a marked peak.

The data used is ^GSPC from yahoo finance (SP500 index).

We aggregate weekly data in compiling the charts.

| symbol | resolution | min                            | max                            | count |
| ---    | ---        | ---                            | ---                            | ---   |
| ^GSPC  | 1wk        | 1927-12-26                     | 2026-02-02                     | 5119  |

The cycle spans 27 years.

The Y axis shows the average change in price for forward returns.
The X axis shows the cycle position for the year from 0 to 26.

Benner marked peaks at 8, 9 and 10 years within the 27-year cycle.
The red highlights show these areas.

The fourth vertical bar represents the chart wrapping back around to zero.

There seems to be some gradual increase in momentum before high years.
After which momentum drops off.

We can see which years had an immediate drop from this chart comparing high to post high years.

Wouldn't use it as a predictor of a specific year when we are likely to see a crash.

However, it's had a quick reaction since 1970.

There's some promise for further investigation into the cycle.
